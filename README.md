# COSC 312: Turing Machine Team Project

* The file "turing_machine.txt" is the configuration file for our Turing Machine.
* Open it in STEM.jar.
* Edit the tape to contain any text.
* Terminate the text with a '$'.  If you do not, it will not stop!
* Your text MAY NOT contain a '$', though this capability may be added at a later date.
